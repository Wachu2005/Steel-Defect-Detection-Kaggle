# Steel-Defect-Detection-Kaggle-Competition

https://www.kaggle.com/c/severstal-steel-defect-detection

Goal of this Competition was to create a model that indecates various types of defect in steel based on images. I designed and built convolutional neural network that predictes one of 5 classes, 0 is non defect. My accuracy on last epoch was 90% but unfortunately i can't access real accuracy from my submission.csv file because this Competition is closed.
